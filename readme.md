#Let's Start Java
Week 9A @ Codecool
###Objectives of this week
- understanding the basics of XML which stands for Extensible Markup Language
- learn JAVA 8 basics using Eclipse Mars IDE

###Personal notes
Before developing a Java application I have to download the Java 8 JDK (Java DevKit). The standalone JRE package is simply not enough, because it's just the Java Runime Environment. NOTE: at this point in time (2016/01) I think that JRE is necessary only when you're not a developer but a user. Without JRE it is not possible to run any Java program.

###Questions
- where to write imports? Before package name, or after?
- how to use the concept of packages?
- if a class has a variable, do I have to set up a getter method in order to retrieve it outside of the class/object?
- ternary operators, how to use them? Do I have to assign it's output to a variable first? I's not working on my sample code.
